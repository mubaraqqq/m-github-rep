## Intro
This was an assessment given to me upon my application to Bitmama for the position of Frontend Developer to work on their Changera product.

## Requirements
I was required to build a React app for my GitHub profile repository using the Github REST endpoint similar to this https://res.cloudinary.com/bitmama/image/upload/v1651075023/Screenshot_2022-04-27_at_16.56.31_c2iejq.png.
A user should be able to login using GitHub OAuth and vuew all their public repositories.
Basically, I was reuired to incorporate the following into the app:
- Login with GitHub OAuth
- Show the first 20 public repositories
- Add loading state
- Use Redux Toolkit to fetch data

## Bonus
- To implement filtering/searching of the repositories
- To deploy the project to netlify or vercel

## Tools Used
- Create React App
- Redux Toolkit, React-Redux
- Material UI
